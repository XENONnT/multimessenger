# Notebooks for Supernova Analysis

The scripts are under `multimessenger/snax/` 


The notebooks;

- [SNAX Demonstration SNAX.ipynb](SNAX.ipynb) <br>
This notebook uses a selected snewpy model to showcase how the calculations are carried out. It is intended to work without the SNAX package for demonstration. The package uses similar logic to perform tasks related to interactions.
- [Staged Sampling](SNAX-staged_sampling.ipynb) <br>
The energy spectra differs during the burst, when sampling a proper strategy needs to be adapted. Therefore, this strategy is investigated and described in this notebook.

- [Tutorial 1](SNAX-package_tutorial.ipynb)<br>
Tutorial on how to use the snax package to load data and investigate.
- [Tutorial 2](SNAX-package_tutorial2-simulated_data.ipynb)<br>
Tutorial on how to use processed data to create simulation files using WFSim for LXe detectors.
